                Hello world! My name is Gracie Davis and I am from Brigham City, UT.
                I have been programming for a few years now, and I hope to continue to persue
                it in the future! I served a mission in Boston, MA, speaking spanish, and have
                been home for about a year. I love to draw and crochet, and I currently work as
                an office admin for the Heritage Auto corporate office. I love my job and my
                amazing family.
