                <p>
                    Hello world! My name is Gracie Davis and I am from Brigham City, UT.
                    I have been programming for a few years now, and I hope to continue to persue
                    it in the future! I served a mission in Boston, MA, speaking spanish, and have
                    been home for about a year. I love to draw and crochet, and I currently work as
                    an office admin for the Heritage Auto corporate office. I love my job and my
                    amazing family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal is to work for a well-known company as a web developer. It is something 
                    I enjoy and know I will continue to grow in this field. I would also like to 
                    start my own business before I retire, using my skills that I learn to lift and 
                    help others.
                </p>
